# ebay-view-bot
The simplest possible requests bot to boost ebay view count. Simply input desired product link (no cached links plz) and desired view count and voila

## TODO (will probably never be done though)
- [ ] txt file for all desired links
- [ ] start on a new link after one finishes instead of finishing script
- [ ] multithreading
- [ ] proxy support

## Installation
Click `clone/download`, unzip file 

In terminal: ```git clone https://github.com/washedgram/ebay-view-bot.git```

## What do i need to run this?
Python, Requests

- [Install Python 3.x.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you have it installed correctly, typing 'python3' in your Terminal will open an interactive console where you can execute Python code. 
- Install Requests: `pip install requests` - need to install python first
